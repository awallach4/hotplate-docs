# Managing Users

Hotplate Console features a user management dashboard that can create, manage, and delete users.  You can also configure Hotplate to be invite-only, which requires you to create users through this dashboard rather than through a form on your site.  Only site administrators will have access to this page.

## Adding a User

To add a user, simply enter the new user's email address in the user creation form and submit it.  This will add the new user's email address to the `new-users` collection which will allow them to create their account.  If you have set up the email service, you can also choose to send the new user an email notifying them of the invitation.  To create their account, the new user simply needs to go to the "Register" page and use the email address that was invited.

## Managing Users

The Hotplate Console user management dashboard lets you change a user's username, set their permission level, disable their account, and sign out their account on all devices.  First, select a user from the table below the user management form.  You cannot select your own account, and administrators are also not allowed to delete their own account, even from their profile page.  If you need to delete your account or downgrade your permission level, another administrator has to do this for you.  Once a user has been selected, use the form to take any actions that you need for that user.  **Be aware that deleting an account is a permanent action and cannot be reversed**.

*Note: Before selecting a user, it is recommended that you refresh the users list to ensure that any recent changes made by the user are reflected.*
