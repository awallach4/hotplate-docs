features:
- title: User-Friendly
  details: Once configured and deployed, Hotplate presents a drag-and-drop site-building interface that can be used by anyone - even those with no coding or web design experience.
- title: Customizable
  details: Hotplate is designed as a customizable alternative to plug-and-play site builders like Google Sites.  While it is much more difficult to get started with Hotplate than site builders like Google Sites, you'll enjoy being able to take advantage of your self-hosted backend and Hotplate's open source code to build exactly the site that you want.
- title: Firebase-Powered
  details: You don't need to know a thing about hosting a server to use Hotplate.  Your Hotplate site is backed by all of Google's secure and performant services, such as Cloud Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Cloud Storage, and reCaptcha v3.  We've even written security rules for you, so all you need to do is deploy them!
